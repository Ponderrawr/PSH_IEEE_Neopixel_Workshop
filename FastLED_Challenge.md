# FastLED Challenge

A series of coding challenges to explore the FastLED library. How many can you complete?

---

## Level 1: Exploring Pixels

1. **Single Pixel Patterns**
   - Make one LED move back and forth like a pendulum across the strip.
   - Challenge: Can you make it accelerate and decelerate naturally?

2. **Random Color Trails**
   - Each LED lights up randomly but leaves a short “trail” behind using fading.

3. **Pixel Counting**
   - Light up a number of LEDs corresponding to a variable (like a “level meter”) and change it dynamically.

## Level 2: Interaction & Input

4. **Button-Controlled Colors**
   - Press a button to change the strip’s color. Cycle through at least 3 colors.

5. **Proximity Sensor Glow**
   - Use a sensor (like an ultrasonic sensor) to change brightness or number of lit LEDs based on distance.

6. **Two-Button Effects**
   - Button A triggers effect X, Button B triggers effect Y. Can you combine them if both are pressed?

## Level 3: Timing and Motion

7. **Wave Patterns**
   - LEDs pulse in a wave pattern across the strip. Challenge: Make it move in both directions simultaneously.

8. **Staggered Chase**
   - A multi-dot “train” moves across the strip with varying spacing and speed.

9. **Random Decay**
   - LEDs light up randomly but fade at different rates, creating a dynamic “organic” look.

## Level 4: Advanced Color & Effects

10. **Gradient Maps**
    - Map a gradient across the strip and animate it like a flowing river of color.

11. **Color Cycling Clock**
    - Use the strip to visualize time or steps of a process. Each LED represents a unit, cycling through hues.

12. **Temperature Map Simulation**
    - LEDs represent “temperature” with different colors. Update the strip dynamically to simulate changes.

## Level 5: Multi-Dimensional Thinking

13. **Split Strip Patterns**
    - Divide the strip into sections, each running a different effect. Challenge: Make effects interact at the boundaries.

14. **Symmetrical Effects**
    - Create mirror patterns along the strip. Can you make both halves independent yet coordinated?

15. **Pattern Sequencer**
    - Predefine several patterns and switch between them automatically every few seconds or based on input.

## Bonus Creative Challenges

16. **Music EQ Display**
    - Make the strip display color patterns that match audio inputs at specific frequencies such as bass or trebel (could be from serial input or sensors).

17. **Particle System**
    - Each LED acts like a particle that moves, collides, or fades based on rules you define.

18. **Ambient Feedback**
    - LEDs respond to external environment changes: light sensor, temperature, or sound sensor readings.

19. **Mini Games**
    - Implement a simple game with LEDs. Example: a reaction timer where LEDs light up randomly and you press a button as fast as possible.

> 💡 **Tip:** The goal isn’t just visual effects. Think about **loops, arrays, timing, randomness, and interaction** as part of each challenge.
